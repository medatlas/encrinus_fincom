# Encrinus decentralized documents management

In the era of cloud storage, the public’s privacy is at risk. Most storage providers encrypt data at rest, but who has the keys? For users who want to take control of their data, Encrinus provides a free application that allows them to encrypt data themselves and not rely on cloud storage providers to protect their privacy. Encrinus decentralized documents management also allows users to restore their lost keys with the public's help.
The underlying document repository can be local using the user’s device storage or remote through cloud storage providers. Cloud storage partners only provide the infrastructure and have no control over the application layer. Partners provide APIs and them to Encrinus external connectors. Users can create multiple local or remote repositories of their choice. The golden rule is that the user always has complete control over their documents. They can store, share, sync, sign, and monetize their documents securely without leaving Encrinus wallet.

The Problem:
While cloud storage solves part of users’ struggles with documents managements, it creates many security challenges and doesn’t provide a user-friendly interface to store, share and sign documents securely. Even when cloud storage offers data encryption at rest and in transit, the end-users don’t have absolute control over their data. The complexity of secret keys management causes centralized cybersecurity solutions to come short and put data owners at risk. The digital transformation also comes with many challenges like the users’ identity and the cost of the electronic signatures.

The solution:
To isolate the cloud storage security issues, we built a decentralized documents access control on top of EOS. We selected the EOS blockchain because of its fine-grained permissions. EOS accounts are designed to efficiently identify users and grant them hierarchical permissions to run selective actions on the blockchain. EOS blockchain is a natural solution to efficiently streamline documents management, including tracking, routing, and electronic signatures. To put it all together, we designed a mobile-friendly application that allows individuals, governments, and businesses to store, share and sign documents securely. The application eliminates the risk of a mass data breach and provides privacy protection. The end-user or organization has complete control over its data. Users can also recover from losing their keys by creating one or more spare keys and using the public’s help to enable them. The application is also empowered by real-time monitoring and notifications. Encrinus also allows creators to monetize their intellectual properties by providing eCommerce solutions to sell their creations directly or through other DeFi blockchain platforms.
